# Hangman
The user needs to guess letters of a word. Whenever they succeed, the letter reveals. Whenever they fail, another part of the "Hangman" reveals. The game is over when the earlier happens: 
1. User wins - the user succeeds to guess the whole word or,
2. User loses - all the parts of the "Hangman" reveal.
